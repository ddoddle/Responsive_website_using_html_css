            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to
                achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student
                is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking in distinguishing education
                from indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of
                education. The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally,
                it can mean the academic field studying education. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is often divided into types. The most common division is
                between formal, non-formal, and informal education. However, some theorists only distinguish between
                formal and informal education. Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework. Such
                frameworks have a chronological and hierarchical order. For instance, the modern schooling system has
                classes based on the student's age and progress, all the way from primary school to university. Formal
                education is usually controlled and guided by the government. It is normally compulsory up to a certain
                age.

                Non-formal and informal education take place outside the formal schooling system. Non-formal education
                is a middle ground. Like formal education, it is organized, systematic, and carried out with a clear
                purpose in mind. Examples are tutoring, fitness classes, and the scouting movement. Informal education,
                on the other hand, happens in an unsystematic way through daily experiences and exposure to the
                environment. Unlike formal and non-formal education, there is usually no designated authority figure
                responsible for teaching. Informal education is present in many settings. It happens throughout one's
                life, mostly in a spontaneous way. This is how children learn their mother tongue from their parents or
                how people learn to prepare a dish by cooking together.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education plays various roles in society, including in social, economic,
                and personal fields. On a social level, education makes it possible to establish and sustain a stable
                society. It helps people acquire the basic skills needed to interact with their environment and fulfill
                their needs and desires. In modern society, this involves a wide range of skills like being able to
                speak, read, and write as well as to solve problems and to perform basic arithmetic tasks. It also
                includes the ability to handle information and communications technology. Children are socialized into
                society by acquiring these skills. Another key part of socialization is to learn how to live in social
                groups and interact with others by coming to understand social and cultural norms and expectations. This
                requires an understanding of what kinds of behavior are considered appropriate in different contexts.
                This way, new members are introduced to the culture, norms, and values that are dominant in their
                society. Socialization happens throughout life but is of special relevance to early childhood education.
                It enables a form of social cohesion, stability, and peace needed for people to productively engage in
                their daily business. Education plays a key role in democracies by increasing civic participation in the
                form of voting and organizing and through its tendency to promote equal opportunity for all.
